# TickTockTone

TickTockTone is a chime application that rings at user-defined times, inspired by traditional cuckoo clocks but with a modern twist. It allows users to select intervals for chimes and even choose the chime sound from available `.mp3` files in the application directory.

## Features

- **Customizable Chime Intervals**: Set the application to chime at specific intervals, such as every hour, every half hour, or even every 10 minutes.
- **Chime Sound Selection**: Choose your preferred chime sound from the `.mp3` files available in the application directory.
- **Simple and Intuitive UI**: Powered by CustomTkinter, the application offers a modern and easy-to-use interface.
